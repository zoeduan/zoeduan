 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zoe
- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte
- ðŸ’» My research interests include recommender systems, action rule mining, business analytics, data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. More specifically, I designed and implemented recommender systems that can provide actionable recommendations to improve customer churn rate based on action rule discovery, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and rough set theory.
