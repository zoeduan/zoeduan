 👋 Hi, I’m Zoe
- 🎓 I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte
- 💻 My research interests include recommender systems, action rule mining, business analytics, data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. More specifically, I designed and implemented recommender systems that can provide actionable recommendations to improve customer churn rate based on action rule discovery, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and rough set theory. 
- 🎨 I like painting
